# Git Repository

The front-end files are stored in a private git repository on Bitbucket. 

```bash
git clone http://repo- Front-end
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
gem install scss-lint
gem install sass
npm install â€”global gulp
```

The installation of the gem's need to be replaced by a Gemfile so that we can run `gem install`
